name: Hey! We're moved!
about: Please report your issue to Developer-Center repo!

---

tl,dr: Please submit your issue to [Developer-Center](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues/) instead of here.

To make issue tracking more effective, we decided to move our issue board to [Developer-Center](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues/), so please submit your bug report, feature request or other issue directly to [Developer-Center](https://github.com/linuxdeepin/developer-center/issues/), and you can also tracking these issue in the [projects](https://github.com/orgs/linuxdeepin/projects) page if you're interested.
